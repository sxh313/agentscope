"""Tests for the standalone channel worker's lifecycle.

The worker is the process that owns the platforms' long connections, so
what matters here is that it opens its backends, stays up, and releases
them on the way out.

Shutdown is deliberately not driven by a real signal: the worker only
installs handlers where the event loop supports them, so on Windows a
raised SIGTERM would take the default action and kill the test process
rather than fail a test. The two halves are checked separately instead
— that the handlers are registered, and that teardown releases
everything.
