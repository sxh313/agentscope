    description: str = """Asks the user multiple-choice questions to gather information, clarify ambiguity, understand preferences, make decisions, or offer choices.

Use this tool when you need to ask the user questions during execution:
1. Gather user preferences or requirements.
2. Clarify ambiguous instructions before proceeding.
3. Get decisions on implementation choices as you work.
4. Offer the user a set of directions to take.

## Usage rules
- You may batch 1–4 questions in a single call; batch related questions together.
- Each question must have 2–4 options. Option labels must be unique within a question.
- Question texts must be unique across the batch.
- Users will always be able to select "Other" to provide free-text input — do not add an "Other" option yourself.
- Use `multi_select: true` only when the choices are genuinely not mutually exclusive.
- If you recommend a specific option, place it first and append "(Recommended)" to its label.
- The `preview` field on an option renders a side-by-side visual comparison; only use it for concrete artifacts (code snippets, ASCII mockups, config examples) where seeing the content helps the user choose. Preview is only supported for single-select questions.
- Put whatever the user must look at to answer — a draft, a diff, an error — in `context` rather than in the question text.

## What comes back
`output` is written for you to read. The caller also returns the same answers in `ToolResultBlock.metadata`, shaped by `AskUserMetadata`, for programs that must branch on the choice rather than read prose."""  # noqa: E501
