    the leader only ever sees the summary, never the member's intermediate
    steps. Members assigned in the same round run concurrently, except that
    assignments to the same member run one after another in call order, a
    later one waiting until the earlier one finishes, even across a HITL
    pause. Members do not talk to each other; a member's result always
    returns to the leader.

    HITL works per participant: a member that needs user confirmation parks
    like any agent, its request is streamed out unchanged, and the result
    sent back to the pipeline is routed to it by ``reply_id``. Meanwhile
    the leader stays parked on the assignment and resumes once the member
