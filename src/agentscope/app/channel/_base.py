"""Channel base abstractions: events, capability, and the channel base.

A channel has exactly three concerns: keep a long-lived connection,
normalise platform payloads into :class:`ChannelEvent` /
:class:`ChannelConfirmationResultEvent` and emit them, and send the
gateway's outbound instructions back to the platform.

The channel never imports or holds the gateway; it receives an ``emit``
callback via :meth:`start_listening` and calls it. The dispatcher, in
turn, only feeds the channel a run's event stream via ``send_response``
(the channel folds and renders it) plus ``send_reaction`` — never its
connection loop.
